While an array($x$ in the case, $a$ in hack) was repeatedly indexed by the other array($adj$ in the case, $b$ in hack), the julia programme cannot get correct derivative of the former array just on GPU (nothing wrong on CPU).
The programme in experiments/subdivnet/why_julia_gpu_is_wrong shows the bug.
